# VirtualPlanner Coding Standards

This document is not yet complete, but these are the standards we have established thus far.

## General Style Guide
- We have chosen to conform to the ruby standard of soft tabs with a length of two spaces. Please set your editor to this tab length, so that no issues will arise.
- All lines should have no trailing whitespace.
- All files should end with a newline character.

## Style Guide for Ruby Files
- All ruby files that are not automatically generated should include a block comment at the top of the file specifying the purpose of the file, all authors of the file, the creation date, and the date of the last modification.
- Use snake_case for methods and variables.
- Use CamelCase for classes and modules.
- Use double quotes for strings in all cases.
